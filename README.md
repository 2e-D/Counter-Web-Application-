# HTML-CSS-JS-Counter

Here i built a simple web application using my knowledge of HTML & CSS and included some of the basic JavaScript I know.

I used minimal tutorial help as i wanted to see what i was capable of just using what I know.


For some reason i can't get the GitHub pages link to load anything other than a 404 error
